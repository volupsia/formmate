## ⚡ What You Can Do with AI

FormCMS isn't just a place to store content; it's an AI-driven development partner. 

### 1. Generate Entity (Schema)
Describe your business domain and AI will design normalized database schemas with relationships and appropriate data types.

### 2. Generate Data (Seeding)
Use AI to generate realistic, high-quality sample data that preserves relational integrity.

### 3. Generate Query (API)
Prompt the AI: "Give me all books published after 2020 by authors with more than 5 stars." It generates the GraphQL query and converts it into a REST endpoint automatically.

### 4. Generate Page (UI)
Go from prompt to page: "Build a landing page for my library that sections books by genre." AI generates the HTML/CSS and bridges it with your data queries.

### 5. Add Engagement Bar
Prompt: "Add likes, bookmarks, shares, and view count to my article page." AI integrates interactive social engagement features automatically.

### 6. Add User Avatar
Prompt: "Show the author's avatar and profile link." AI adds user identity components to your pages.

### 7. View History in Portal
Access all your generated schemas, queries, and pages in the portal. Compare versions and rollback changes anytime.
