## ⚡ What You Can Do with AI

FormCMS acts as your AI-driven development partner. Describe what you want, and it builds it:

- **Generate the Full Stack**: Entities (schemas), Seed Data, GraphQL Queries, and UI Pages from natural language.
- **Add Engagement Instantly**: "Add a like button" or "Show user avatar" simply works.
- **Manage & Iterate**: View version history and manage artifacts in the visual portal.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get the project running locally in 5 steps.

### 1. Clone Repositories
```bash
git clone git@github.com:formcms/formcms.git
git clone git@github.com:formcms/formmate.git
```

### 2. Start Backend (FormCMS)
```bash
cd formcms/server/FormCMS.MonoApp
dotnet run
```
_Verify that `http://127.0.0.1:5000` is accessible._

### 3. Start FormMate Service
Open a new terminal:
```bash
cd formmate
npm i
npm run build:all
npm run dev:service
```

### 4. Initial Setup
Visit **http://localhost:3001/mate** — before the system is ready, you'll be guided through a setup page:

1. **Setup Database Connection** — choose your database provider and configure the connection string.
2. **Create Super Admin** — add an initial super admin user account.
3. **Restart Backend** — after completing steps 1 and 2, the backend will quit. Follow [Step 2](#2-start-backend-formcms) to restart it. _(In a Docker deployment, the container will auto-restart.)_
4. **Setup Gemini API Key** — configure your Gemini API key for AI features.

Once setup is complete, visit **http://localhost:3001/mate** to start building!


### 💡 Try it out
Once running, try these prompts:
- "Design entities for a library management system"
- "Add sample data for the book entity"
- "Create a query to display all available books"
