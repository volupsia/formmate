# Personalized Health Task App (FormCMS Demo)

## 1. Overview

This document describes a **small but engaging demo application** built with **React + FormCMS**, focused on helping users reduce stress and improve well‑being through daily health tasks.

The app demonstrates how FormCMS can power **dynamic schemas, user‑defined goals, and interactive business logic** without hard‑coding backend models.

---

## 2. Product Vision

**Goal:**
Help users release pressure and build healthy habits by tracking daily progress and receiving a personalized wellness score.

**Core idea:**

> Users set their own health goals, log daily progress, and receive a daily balance score with feedback.

This app is not a medical tool. It is a **habit and self‑reflection assistant**.

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 Daily Health Tasks

Supported habit categories:

* 🥗 Healthy Eating
* 🏃 Exercise
* 😴 Sleep
* 🧘 Meditation
* 🙏 Gratitude

Each habit:

* Has a unit (minutes, hours, yes/no)
* Has a recommended default target
* Contributes to a daily score

---

### 3.2 User‑Defined Goals (Key Feature)

Users can:

* Customize daily targets per habit
* Adjust difficulty to fit their lifestyle
* Change goals at any time

**Example:**

* Sleep goal: 7 → 8 hours
* Meditation: 5 → 15 minutes
* Exercise: 20 → 30 minutes

This increases:

* Ownership
* Motivation
* Retention

---

### 3.3 Daily Logging

Each day, users:

* Input actual values for each habit
* Optionally add short notes
* See real‑time score updates

No fixed form — the UI is **generated dynamically** from schema definitions.

### 3.4 Daily Balance Score

The app calculates a **Daily Balance Score (0–100)**.

**Basic formula:**

```
HabitScore = min(Actual / Target, 1.0) × Weight
TotalScore = sum(HabitScores)
```

**Score levels:**

* 0–49  → Low / Recovering
* 50–69 → Improving
* 70–89 → Balanced
* 90–100 → Thriving

---

### 3.5 Feedback & Motivation

Based on score:

* Encouraging message
* Gentle suggestions

Examples:

* “Great balance today. Keep it up!”
* “Sleep was low — consider an earlier bedtime.”

---
