## No-Code App Building with AI

### Vision: FormCMS Studio

**Concept:** Users build full-stack apps through natural language conversation with AI, without writing code.

### User Flow

**1. User Describes App:**
```
User: "I want to build a recipe sharing app where users can:
- Post recipes with ingredients and instructions
- Rate and comment on recipes
- Search by ingredients
- Save favorite recipes"
```

**2. AI Generates Everything:**
```typescript
// AI analyzes requirements
const analysis = await ai.analyzeRequirements(userPrompt);

// AI generates FormCMS schemas
const schemas = await ai.generateSchemas(analysis);
// → Recipe, Ingredient, Rating, Comment, User entities

// AI generates queries
const queries = await ai.generateQueries(schemas);
// → searchByIngredient, getTopRated, getUserFavorites

// AI generates React components
const components = await ai.generateComponents(schemas);
// → RecipeCard, RecipeForm, SearchBar, RatingStars

// AI generates pages
const pages = await ai.generatePages(components);
// → HomePage, RecipePage, SearchPage, ProfilePage
```

**3. FormCMS Deploys:**
```typescript
// One-click deployment
await formcms.deploy({
  schemas,
  queries,
  components,
  pages,
  database: 'postgresql',
  hosting: 'railway'
});
```

**4. User Customizes:**
- Visual schema editor (drag-and-drop fields)
- Theme customization (colors, fonts, layout)
- Component library (swap out components)
- Deploy preview (see changes live)

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Enhanced AI Integration (Q1 2026)

**Features:**
- Natural language to schema conversion
- AI-suggested relationships between entities
- Auto-generate CRUD operations
- AI-powered query builder

**Example:**
```
User: "Add a rating system to recipes"
AI: "I'll create a Rating entity with:
     - recipeId (relationship to Recipe)
     - userId (relationship to User)
     - stars (1-5)
     - comment (optional text)
     
     And add these queries:
     - getAverageRating(recipeId)
     - getUserRating(recipeId, userId)
     
     Should I also add a 'helpful' vote system?"
```

#### Phase 2: Visual Builder (Q2 2026)

**Features:**
- Drag-and-drop page builder (like Webflow)
- Component marketplace
- Visual schema editor
- Real-time preview
- Theme templates

**UI Concept:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  FormCMS Studio                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [Schemas] [Queries] [Pages] [Deploy]  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐  │
│  │  Components │  │   Canvas        │  │
│  │             │  │                 │  │
│  │  □ Header   │  │  ┌───────────┐ │  │
│  │  □ Card     │  │  │  Header   │ │  │
│  │  □ Form     │  │  ├───────────┤ │  │
│  │  □ List     │  │  │  Content  │ │  │
│  │  □ Footer   │  │  └───────────┘ │  │
│  └─────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Phase 3: Marketplace (Q3 2026)

**Features:**
- Pre-built templates (blog, ecommerce, etc.)
- Community-contributed components
- One-click install
- Template customization
- Revenue sharing for creators
