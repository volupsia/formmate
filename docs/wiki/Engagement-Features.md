## Architecture

### Backend (**formcms** repo)

The **FormCMS** backend handles all engagement data with buffered writes for performance:

```
User Action → API Call → Memory Buffer → Batch Write (every minute) → Database
```

**Performance:**
- P95 latency: 19ms at 4,200 QPS
- Supports 100M+ activity records
- Sharding-ready for large-scale deployments

### Frontend (**formmate** repo)

The SDK in `packages/backend/public/` provides client-side access. See [Page Templates & Interactivity](./Page-Templates-Interactivity.md#page--sdk-interaction) for SDK usage details.

## Integration

### Adding Engagement Bar to a Page

The AI Page Builder automatically includes the Engagement Bar component. It uses Handlebars + Alpine.js:

```html
<div x-data="{ ... }" x-init="window.mateSdk.engagementService.getStats('{{entityName}}')">
    <!-- Like, Share, Bookmark buttons -->
</div>
```

See [Page Templates & Interactivity](./Page-Templates-Interactivity.md) for SDK details.

## Best Practices

1. **Always seed data** – Engagement features need records to track
2. **Use buffered writes** – Default behavior, don't disable for high-traffic sites
3. **Consider caching** – Engagement counts can be cached at CDN level
4. **Privacy** – Respect user preferences for tracking
