## 3. FormCmsAdminApp (Management Dashboard)

A sleek, **React-based** administrative interface.

### Features:

## 4. Pages (Frontend)

Server-side rendered pages for end users to browse content.

### How It Works:
1. **Template Storage**: Handlebars templates are saved to FormCMS database
2. **Server Rendering**: FormCMS backend reads the template, executes the page's query definition to load data, and renders HTML
3. **Dynamic Hydration**: After the page loads in the browser, Alpine.js fetches and displays dynamic social data (likes, views, etc.)

### Features:
- **SEO Optimized**: Server-rendered HTML for search engine visibility
- **Handlebars Templating**: Flexible server-side rendering with Handlebars
- **Built-in Routing**: Automatic routes based on page configuration
- **Cached for Performance**: Response caching for fast page loads
- **Social Features**: Built-in likes, shares, views, and toplist

## 5. FormCmsPortal (User Portal)

A personalized portal where users can manage their social engagement and content.

### Features:
- **History**: View previously accessed content
- **Liked Items**: Browse and manage liked content
